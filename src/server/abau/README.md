ABAU (Another Bad Administrator Utility)

Another Roblox administrator system for ~~my~~ games to use.

**NOTE: This is still obviously in the works!**

Features:
- Service Hooking (Chat Tags, Overhead Tags)
- Modular UI (In-Dev)
- Basic Moderation (Banning, kicking, Ban listing)
- Client visual debugging (Player Trackers, Line ESP)
- Tab Completion, Console History Scrolling (UP/DOWN arrow keys)
- Server Tasks (For user moderation)
- Easy config

## Getting Started

1. Download the Latest release in Releases (File ending in **.rbxlx**)
2. Drag the file into your Roblox Studio Workspace or Viewport.
3. Move the **"abau"** folder to ServerScriptService. Preferably in a folder named **"Server"** for organization.
4. Config the system by going to: **"abau" -> "server" -> "config"**

Other than that, **"it should just work"**, and that's it!

(Also press F2 to open console)
