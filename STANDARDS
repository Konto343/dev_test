# a personal list of standards to apply during developement

1. All physical objects must comply with the world grid or local grid.

2. All basic part instances (e.g walls, ceilings, floors) whose 
size on any axis shall only be: 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.0625, etc.
(Except model DETAILS. The base model's frame must comply with rule above.)
    All "large" objects are 4x4 studs (x, z)
    A room's wall height should be 12 studs.
    Walls "outline" or border a room's floor.

3. Any model whose use is large scale, must be converted to package before being 
applied across the world scene.

4. Code rules:
    Code cannot be duplicated. 
    Module dependencies must be injected locally. 
    Always use --!strict
    Using OOP when absolutely needed. (Dont overcomplicate it)
    Leverage modern API methods when possible.
    Dont deep nest code, duh.
    Use (snake_case) naming convention for variables, methods, and objects.
    NEVER UPPER CASE VARIABLES, NOR THEIR FIRST LETTER.
    Be simple.
    
5. naming rules:
    "depend" = dependencies
